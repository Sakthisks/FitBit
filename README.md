This software Calculates health index of a person based on some parameters. These parameters affect person health in both positive and negative way. 

After collecting information about the user, our module will use a formula which takes all the user values as an input and produces an output, this output gives tips to the user on how he or she can increase her health index and be healthy.

Also, as an output, we will portray a bar graph based on usersâ€™ daily habits by which the user will know what are the things user should balance or decrease the intake amount in order to have good health.
